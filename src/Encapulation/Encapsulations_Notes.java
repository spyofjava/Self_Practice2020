Encapsulation
- What is Encapsulation?
- Access modifiers in relation to variables, methods, classes
- Immutability (How can it be achieved)
- Hiding data, providing public access



    What is Encapsulation?
    - hiding the data by using private
    - We can not access private variables from another class.But we can access by using getter and setter methods in Encapsulation

    What is setter and getter?
    -Setter :we use this method to set and reinitialize to private variables

    -Getter :we use this method to call the private variables
    -whatever we use variable type for the private variable, our return type needs to be the same as that.
